I wrote this python program to perform web scrapping on the website https://www.transfermarkt.com/ so that I can extract desired football data. It can:

1. Get league tables of top 5 league in any year
2. Get top scorers data

I attached all 5 other csv files to demonstrate how the final result would look like.

Just a heads-up, I will be labelling them as the second year of a standard season. For example if it's the 2022-23 season, I'll label it as season 2023.

so I'm collecting all the tables from 1992-1993 to 2023-24 season, you can change the value '1992' in the for loop to any value you want to go even further back.
