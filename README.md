I wrote this python program to perform web scrapping on the website https://www.transfermarkt.com/ so that I can extract desired football data. It can:

1. Get league tables of top 5 league in any year
2. Get top scorers data

You can check the example folder to see what it looks like

I created a GUI using PyQt6 to make it more convenient to scrap data, just run python app.py
